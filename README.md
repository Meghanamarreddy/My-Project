PHONE BOOK MANAGER USING BINARY SEARCH TREE
This Demonstrates the phonebook management system with Binary Search Tree. It
has mainly three operations Searching, Sorting, Deleting. These three operation can be
performed efficiently with Binary Search Tree. These three operation can be
performed efficiently (among above data structures) with Binary Search Tree. Binary
search Tree gives the sorted phonebook display naturally without any sorting
operations.

OPERATIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Search
2. Insertion/Creation - Insert
3. All Contacts Information - Display
4. Removal - Delete
5. Change a Phone number - Update
6. Exit
7.

Binary Search Tree (BST) is the Data Structure used in our project
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a Comparable key
(and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger
than the keys in all nodes in that node's left sub tree and smaller than the keys in all
nodes in that node's right sub tree.

1. Binary Search tree can be defined as a class of binary trees, in which the nodes
are arranged in a specific order. This is also called ordered binary tree.
2. In a binary search tree, the value of all the nodes in the left sub-tree is less than
the value of the root.
3. Similarly, value of all the nodes in the right sub-tree is greater than or equal to
the value of the root.
4. This rule will be recursively applied to all the left and right sub-trees of the root


1. Searching become very efficient in a binary search tree since, we get a hint at
each step, about which sub-tree contains the desired element.
2. The binary search tree is considered as efficient data structure in compare to
arrays and linked lists. In searching process, it removes half sub-tree at every
step. Searching for an element in a binary search tree takes o(log2n) time. In
worst case, the time it takes to search an element is 0(n).
3. It also speed up the insertion and deletion operations as compare to that in
array and linked list.
